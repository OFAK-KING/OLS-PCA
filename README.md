# OLS-PCA
analyze area(target) is linearly related to the other features  in the dataset. Split your data into 80:20 and compare R^2 to see the goodness of fit. Make conclusions on if this model can be linearly fit. Corroborate your answer with statistics.  2. Use dimensionality reduction techniques to shrink features to a smaller number and re-fit the model linearly. Are your PCA components capturing the variance of your target?
