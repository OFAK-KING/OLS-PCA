# OLS-PCA
The repository is analyzing area(target) which is linearly related to the other features  in the dataset. We did so by split data into 80:20 and compare R^2 to see the goodness of fit. Conclusions was was made on if the model could be linearly fitted by Corroborating answer with statistics.  Repository Used dimensionality reduction techniques to shrink features to a smaller number and re-fitted the model linearly and the checked if PCA components captured the variance of the target
